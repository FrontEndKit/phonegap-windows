PhoneGap-Windows
=============================================================
PhoneGap-Windows is just like PhoneGap on mobile phones 
except that it is for the desktop. Makes sense right? There 
are definitely some other similar solutions out there but I
figured we might as well try it out with the PhoneGap 
JavaScript APIs.


Getting started
-------------------------------------------------------------
This uses an awesome open source implementation of WebKit on 
Windows called WebKit.NET that can be downloaded from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/webkitdotnet

You will want to get the version 0.3 source and fix the link 
in the provided Visual Studio .NET 2008 solution file to get 
it working.

Once you get past that it is pretty sweet, you can start 
building native Windows apps with Canvas!
